- Compared package WDI Worldbank and Quality of Government data
    1. wdi_povhc190 == SI.POV.DDAY & wdi_povhc310 == SI.POV.2D
    2. Decision for SI.POV.DDAY, b/c closest in line with paper
    3. AnteilabsolutArme correlates only weakly with other head counts
    4. Valid observations in only 6 per cent of all country years
    5. Distributions by regime type highly unstable b/c very few valid
        observations for all but electoral regimes
